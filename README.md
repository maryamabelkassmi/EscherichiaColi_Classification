# EscherichiaColi_Classification

**E.Coli DNA Classification using SVM**

In this project, We'll use support vector machines algorithim in order to classify short E.Coli DNA sequences.

E.Coli dataset was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that has 106 DNA sequences, with 57 sequential nucleotides (“base-pairs”) each.

In order to perform our ML algorithm we'll follow these steps: 
  1. Data preprocessing 
  2. Training and Testing the Classification Algorithm
  3.  Model Evaluation
  4. Trying different SVM kernels
  5. Hyperparameter Optimization
